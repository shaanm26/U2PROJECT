//Your task is to create your own Java application that serves some purpose or has a general
//theme. You can choose to create a game, a simulation, or just a simple program that does some
//task given some input. Keep it fairly simple; you will have about one week to complete this!

//1. Your project must include at least one class file and one runner file.          | Refer back, constructor.
//2. Your class file can be a static or non-static class                             | Non-Static Method
//3. You should be using iteration and conditional statements in some way            | If/else
//4. Your program should have some sort of "random" element involved                 | Math.Random
//5. Your program should NOT just be a re-creation of something that already exists. | Has to be original
